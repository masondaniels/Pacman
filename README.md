# Pacman Remake
Remake of pacman from scratch in Java.
## Goals
Complete pacman and create co-op multiplayer pacman. Perhaps add deep learning stuff -- if I ever get to that.
## GIFs
Below are some GIFs of previous builds. Currently ghosts are not released from anywhere, they just all spawn at once from (68, 140). Chase, scatter, and frightened mode are already implemented -- though frightened mode cannot be accessed yet. The window can scale and maintain its aspect ratio. Pacman cannot die yet.

The lines point to ghost's goals & rectangles are bounds of tiles. When bounds change colors this represents bounds checked by collision detection.
